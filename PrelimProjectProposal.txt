PROJECT TRACK:
Healthcare industry - mental health in tech industry workers.


PROJECT OUTLINE:
Tech workers experience precarious employment, unpredictable working hours, sedentary, and often socially isolating working conditions. These are likely to have significant impacts on workers' mental and physical health.
Tech workers' mental health is also likely to be impacted by a family history of mental illness. Workplace culture is also likely to impact on the likelihood that workers will disclose mental health conditions.


RESEARCH QUESION(S):
1. What is the self-reported prevalence of mental health conditions amongst tech industry workers in different countries?
2. What is the impact of employer wellness programs?
3. Does this vary between remote vs. office-based workers?
4. Does this vary between those with and without a family history of mental illness?
5. To what extent does workplace culture explain the likelihood that a person will disclose a mental health condition?
6. Possibly, also comparison pre-COVID-19 versus after COVID-19 (subject to statistical power).


PROPOSED API(S) & DATASETS:
Mental Health in the Tech Workplace. Resouces available from: https://osmhhelp.org/research.html (accessed 2 April 2024).


PROPOSED ANALYSES:
1. Bar charts by country, or possibly mapping-based API for visualisation.
  2014 data
  'treatment'= yes, new dataframe created.

  2020 data
  

2. Pie chart by employer wellness programs.
  2014 data
  'wellness_program', break down into value_counts for "Yes", "No" and "Don't Know"

  2020 data

3. Pie charts by remote vs. office-based workers. *might need 2 charts here, one for % of remote workers overall vs % of remote workers with mental health issues. 
  2014 data
  'remote_work' == 'yes' then filter by remote workers that report mental health issues, ie 'treatment' == 'Yes'

  2020 data 

4. Pie chart by family history of mental illness.
  2014 data
 filter by 'family_history' == 'Yes' vs 'treatment' column value_counts

  2020 data

5. Pie chart by workplace culture.
  2014 data
  'seek_help' or 'mental_health_consequence'

  2020 data
6. Multivariate regression of all factors together.
7. Line chart over a time series analysis to examine impact of COVID-19.
