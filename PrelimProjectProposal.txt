PROJECT TRACK:
Healthcare industry - mental health in tech industry workers.


PROJECT OUTLINE:
Tech workers experience precarious employment, unpredictable working hours, sedentary, and often socially isolating working conditions. These are likely to have significant impacts on workers' mental and physical health.
Tech workers' mental health is also likely to be impacted by a family history of mental illness. Workplace culture is also likely to impact on the likelihood that workers will disclose mental health conditions.


RESEARCH QUESION(S):
1. What is the self-reported prevalence of mental health conditions amongst tech industry workers in different countries?
2. What is the impact of employer wellness programs?
3. Does this vary between remote vs. office-based workers?
4. Does this vary between those with and without a family history of mental illness?
5. To what extent does workplace culture explain the likelihood that a person will disclose a mental health condition?


PROPOSED API(S) & DATASETS:
Mental Health in the Tech Workplace. Resouces available from: https://osmhhelp.org/research.html (accessed 2 April 2024).


PROPOSED ANALYSES:
1. Bar charts by country.
2. Pie chart by employer wellness programs.
3. Pie chart by remote vs. office-based workers.
4. Pie chart by family history of mental illness.
5. Regression for workplace culture on likelihood of disclosure.
