Tech workers experience precarious employment, unpredictable working hours, sedentary, and often socially isolating working conditions. Research on psychosocial working conditions suggests that these factors are likely to have significant impacts on workers' mental and physical health. Increasingly, research is suggseting that workplace cultures that encourage workers to disclose their mental health issues to colleagues and supervisors may improve the likelihood that workers will disclose mental health conditions, leading to better long-term outcomes for tech workers. 

The aims of this project are therefore to explore the factors that impact on tech workers mental health over two observation periods, before the COVID-19 pandemic (2014) compared with during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022).



## Project Description:
The research questions are:
1. What is the self-reported prevalence of mental health conditions amongst tech industry workers in different countries?
2. What is the impact of employer wellness programs?
3. Does this vary between remote vs. office-based workers?
4. Does this vary between those with and without a family history of mental illness?
5. To what extent does workplace culture explain the likelihood that a person will disclose a mental health condition?
6. Possibly, also comparison pre-COVID-19 versus after COVID-19 (subject to statistical power).
